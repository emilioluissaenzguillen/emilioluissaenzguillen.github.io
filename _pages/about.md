Welcome! I am an Actuary and Economist, interested in the study of mortality and financial risk factors. Currently I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Actuarial Science at Bayes Business School. My research to date has focused on the development of gradient boosting methods and generalized additive models using Geometrically Designed (GeD) splines.

Prior to my Ph.D., I have worked as Research Assistant examining the impact of stakeholders’ ESG pressures on banking behaviour, and the potential moral hazards introduced by government bailout guarantees. In a previous engagement, I worked jointly with the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA), studying the effect of network centrality on interest rate spreads in Argentine interbank markets.
